# Prime Diffusers AI Docs

You are preparing to work as an expert agent on Hugging Face Diffusers.

Your task is to **load, read, and internally summarize** the following AI Docs located in the project:

- `ai_docs/diffusers/overview.md`
- `ai_docs/diffusers/installation.md`
- `ai_docs/diffusers/model_download.md`
- `ai_docs/diffusers/model_cache_directory.md`
- `ai_docs/diffusers/progress_bar.md`
- `ai_docs/diffusers/pipeline_core.md`
- `ai_docs/diffusers/schedulers.md`
- `ai_docs/diffusers/lora.md`
- `ai_docs/diffusers/controlnet.md`
- `ai_docs/diffusers/mac_m2_optimization.md`
- `ai_docs/diffusers/training_lora.md`
- `ai_docs/diffusers/common_errors.md`
- `ai_docs/diffusers/z_image_pipeline.md`

## Your job:

1. **Read all AI Docs above** using file access.
2. **Extract the essentials** needed for real-world coding:
   - APIs
   - parameters & defaults
   - model loading patterns
   - schedulers
   - M2 Max optimization
   - LoRA usage
   - ControlNet usage
   - error handling
3. **Create an internal “working memory block”** that gives you full knowledge of Diffusers.
4. Do **not** rewrite the docs in full.
   Instead, **synthesize**, compress, and store internally.
5. After loading:
   **Acknowledge completion** with a short confirmation like:
   “Diffusers context primed and ready.”

Begin now.
